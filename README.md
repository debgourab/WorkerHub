## Pages

| Page | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html` | Main landing page with search and service categories |
| `workers.html` | Browse and filter workers |
| `worker-details.html` | View a selected worker profile |
| `booking.html` | Submit a booking request |
| `customer-dashboard.html` | Track customer bookings |
| `worker-dashboard.html` | Track worker jobs and profile status |
| `login.html` | Demo login page |
| `register.html` | Demo account registration page |
| `about.html` | Marketplace information |
| `contact.html` | Contact form |

## How To Run

Open the project folder in a terminal:

```bash
cd LaborConnect
```

Start a local server:

```bash
python -m http.server 5173
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5173/index.html
```

A local server is recommended because the app loads worker data from `data/workers.json`.

## Demo Flow

1. Open `index.html`.
2. Search for a service or go to `workers.html`.
3. Filter workers by service, location, rating, and hourly rate.
4. Open a worker profile.
5. Submit a booking request.
6. View saved booking requests in `customer-dashboard.html`.

## Data Source

Worker profiles are stored in:

```text
data/workers.json
```

Each worker includes:

- Name
- Service category
- Location
- Rating
- Hourly rate
- Experience
- Availability
- Skills
- Bio
- Reviews
- Profile image path

## Customization Ideas

- Replace demo workers with real worker data
- Add backend authentication
- Store bookings in a database
- Add payment status and invoice screens
- Add worker verification document uploads
- Add search by city or pin code
- Add admin dashboard for approvals and disputes

## Notes

This is a frontend prototype. Login, registration, contact, and booking flows are simulated in the browser for demonstration purposes.
